I write open-sourced software 🧑‍💻 at Algorand [1], where I work on programmability, smart-contract languages, and developer infrastructure to power blockchain/Web3 apps. I previously did research on Ethereum/EVM-based systems, which led to publications at [ACM PLDI '20](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3385412.3385982) and [IEEE ICBC '22](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBC54727.2022.9805484) ([Distinguished Paper](https://icbc2022.ieee-icbc.org/program/distinguished-papers)). Before "Web3", I built "Web2" microservices at Google 🔎 and AWS 📦[2].

I'm also interested in Computer Science education 🧑‍🏫. I teach as an Adjunct at Boston University and Wentworth Tech on various CS topics. I also helped teach 8 ECE courses at the University Toronto 🍁, where I received my BASc and MSc.

My hobbies are making loud noises on my trombone 🎶 and chasing around soccer balls ⚽🏃.

#### Notes

[1] Founded by Turing Award Cryptographer [Silvio Micali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Micali), most well-known for his work on interactive proofs and zero-knowledge protocols. The github is [here](https://github.com/algorand).
[2] I put them in quotes because I think "Web2" and "Web3" are meaningless buzzwords.
