title: "Why I write"
---

### Motivation

I'm starting a blog for two reasons. The obvious reason is that I want to get better at writing.
The other reason is that I want to talk through my thoughts aloud. Putting pen to paper helps me flesh out what I don't know and helps me fill in those missing gaps. And everyday, I realize that there is much I don't know about myself and the world around me.

I'd like to stick to three core principles in my writing:

* **Concise** - we are constantly flooded with information, so I want help make it simpler and faster for people to consume knowledge.
* **Accessible** - what's the point of writing if no one is able to understand it?
* **Accurate** [^1] - who wants to read fake news? ðŸ¤”

### Ground rules

The average human reads text at ~200 words per minute [^2]. Excluding footnotes and references, every blogpost should be able to be read under 2 minutes, or 400 words in length. This also makes reading (and writing!) low stakes. Worst case, you'll only have to suffer a couple minutes from my writing ðŸ˜‹.
