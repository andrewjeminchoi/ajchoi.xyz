title: "On AI Anxiety: Why we shouldn’t fear the computer"
---

I gave a talk on “automation anxiety” in 2020 [^1] to explore reasons why people are (rightfully) scared that computers will take their jobs.
This was before ChatGPT was a thing, and events like the [ongoing Writers' strikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike) [^2] only emphasize the importance of equipping the right tools in the labor markets today.

On the other hand, I think AI will have an extremely hard time taking over the world in the short run. I’ll give three reasons why:

1. **Economics of automation**: Software is notoriously becoming harder to design, maintain and develop. It might just be easier and cheaper to hire humans to do certain tasks. Despite technological advances in automobiles 🚗 and airplanes ✈️, there’s a reason why bipedal modes of transport haven't become obsolete yet. 🏃‍♂️💨💨

2. **Political and Cultural significance**: In [Bullshit Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs), Anthropologist David Graebel posits that governments and the rich create jobs as a means of asserting power and to stroke their own egos. Sometimes, jobs carry cultural and ancestral value. For some of us, it’s even a part of our (literal) identity, as under the feudal system, people often named themselves after their trade, such as [Barber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Barber) 💇, [Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_(surname)) 🎣, or [Cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook) 🧑‍🍳 [^3]. So even with technological advancements, it looks like we’ll always have artificial demand for jobs, bullshit or not.

3. **Rise in consumption**: We seem to work more today than we did in the 1950s to be able to afford and acquire more things [^4]. Economist Juliet Schor notes that comfort is no longer enough, and luxuries have become necessities for us. If [hedonistic adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill) continues to run its course, our insatiable thirst for stuff will overwhelm our AI overlords, and we'll have no choice but to step in and bridge the gap in production 🏭.

Despite all the pessimism surrounding AI, I think there's plenty of room for humble laborers like us to continue our life of service. John Maynard Keynes mused that his grandchildren would only work 15-hour work weeks [^5]. It goes to show that crystal balls don’t exist, even for renowned economists 🤕.

#### Notes

[^1]: This was a Lightning Talk at UKC2020, booklet available [here](https://www.ukc.ksea.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/UKC_2020_Report-Book_1.25.pdf). I even got a shout out in page 97 😆! This talk was inspired by a [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/1907/04/25/archives/lamplighters-quit-city-dark-in-spots-police-reserves-out-in-harlem.html) about lamplighters going on strike in 1907.

[^2]: It's important to note that limiting the use of AI is only a part of their platform. I'm not trying to strawman the entire movement here.

[^5]: [John Maynard Keynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes), along with his opponent [Friedrich  Hayek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek), is considered to be one of the most influential figures in modern economics. In 1930, he wrote this [essay]( https://www.aspeninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/files/content/upload/Intro_and_Section_I.pdf) on why we should be optimistic about the economies of the future, and why his grandchildren will enjoy a life of leisure.
